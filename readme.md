<p>The Absolute Happiness WordPress Plugin helps you take advantage of the Happiness Advantage by training your brain to scan for the positive first.</p>

<p>This plugin is based on the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307591549">The Happiness Advantage</a> by Shawn Achor. If reading is not so much your thing check out <a href="http://on.ted.com/Achor">Achor's funny and informative Ted Talk</a> about how your happiness affects your work. I also suggest that you head over to Twitter and give <a href="https://twitter.com/shawnachor">Achor a follow</a>.</p>

<blockquote>"the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality. And if we can change the lens, not only can we change your happiness, we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time." -Shawn Archer</blockquote>

<h3>Why Bother?</h3>
<p>We each have a happiness baseline that we fluctuate around daily.<br />
  <strong>The following things contribute to that happiness:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Pursuing meaningful life goals.</li>
  <li>Scanning the world for opportunities.</li>
  <li>Cultivating an optimistic and Grateful Mindset.</li>
  <li>Holding on to rich social relationships.</li>
  <li>Focusing on, and living in small momentary blips of happiness and positivity.</li>
  <li>Think about a personal activity that boosts your happiness - and do it!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where do I focus?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>3 Gratitudes</strong> - List out three things that they are grateful for each day, not specifically from the last 24 hours, but anything at all that you can think of. Doing this as a daily exercise your brain will learn to scan the world for the positives first.</li>
  <li><strong>Journaling</strong> - Write about 1 positive experience from the last 24 hours this allows you to relive it. This activity, much like the first one, trains your brain to think about and focus on the positives first.</li>
  <li><strong>Exercise</strong> - Teach you and your body that your behavior matters.</li>
  <li><strong>Meditation</strong> - 5 minutes each day to watch your breath go in and out, when doing this, try to remain patient and if you feel your mind drifting bring it back to focus. this will take practice, but it is one of the most powerful happiness lifters. Shortly after meditation you will feel calm and contentment and you will increase your awareness and empathy. Longer term affects of regular meditation include the rewiring of the brain to elevate your happiness baseline, reduce stress, and improve immune function.</li>
  <li><strong>Conscious Acts of Kindness</strong> - Write 1 positive email praising or thanking someone in their social support network. Alternatively plan and carry out one positive act for someone in your social network, then write about it here, reflect on what you did and how it made you and the recipient of your positive act feel.</li>
</ul>
